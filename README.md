# SUMMARY
I just used Terminal for this assignment and uploaded my projects from the previous Bootswatch assignment onto GitHub via Terminal.

The main commands used to upload the Bootswatch assignment included
 * **cd** MMART167 folder in my Desktop --> **cd** terminal (which contains my project files)
 * **git** status
 * **git** add Bootswatch (when already in the terminal folder)
 * **git** status
 * **git** commit -m "second commit"
 * **git** push origin
  
  This uploads the Bootswatch folder which contains the files from Assignment 4.

  Next, I created a list for my command history by inputting 
  
  ** history > history_BYamzon.txt
  
  Afterwards, I followed the commands above to export this text file containing my command history into Github.
